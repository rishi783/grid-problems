# grid-problems
coverting one sequence to another-two arrays are given , one array's elements need to be coverted exactly to another so how many changes need to done remove an integer ,
insert a integer and modify an integer. [1,2,3,4,5,6] [1,2,4,5,8]   we have to make 2 changes (insert 3 and change 8 in second array).

longest common sequence - 2 arrays are given , u need to find the longest similar sequence btn 2 arrays for example [1,2,3,4,5,7] [3,4,5,8,7] the longest similar sequence is [3,4,5]

most common sequence - 2 arrays are given , u need to find the  most number of similar elements only moving forward .[1,2,3,4,5,6] [2,1,4,3,6,5] then answer is if we are comparing 1st array with 2nd 1,3,5 .If we are comparing 2nd with 1st then 2,4,6 either way similarities are only 3.
